# Tech Requirements for a Kargo

# Executive Summary

A quick‑commerce auto‑parts network is fundamentally a **technology-first business**. The speed, accuracy, reliability, and scale of the model are entirely dependent on advanced systems including:

* High‑performance mobile apps with AI-driven search and personalisation
* A pan-india order, inventory, fulfilment, and routing engine operating in real time
* Automated procurement and stock movement systems
* Predictive analytics and ML‑driven pricing
* AI‑based customer communication tools
* End‑to‑end visibility through dashboards and analytics
* A highly modular, fault‑tolerant backend capable of supporting multi-city operations simultaneously

This is not a logistics business with some tech attached — **the technology *is* the operating system of the business**.
