## 🗺️ The Tech Roadmap

Our roadmap is structured to evolve from a robust logistics foundation to a hyper-automated, self-optimizing network.

### **Phase 1: The Core Foundation (Logistics & Inventory)**
*   **Omni-channel Network:** Building the Garage-facing App, Delivery Partner App, and Dark Store App.
*   **Central Nervous System:** Deployment of the **OMS** (Order Management) and **IMS** (Inventory Management) to sync stock in real-time across all nodes.
*   **Parts Intelligence:** Establishing a structured auto-parts database with OEM/OES cross-compatibility.

### **Phase 2: Operational Intelligence (Efficiency at Scale)**
*   **Dynamic Routing:** Implementing the **Fulfilment & Routing Engine** for SLA-driven node selection and load balancing.
*   **Procurement Automation:** Data-driven procurement layers to automate purchase requests and supplier reconciliation.
*   **Customer Lifecycle:** Integration of a CRM system with automated engagement workflows for retention.

### **Phase 3: Cognitive Excellence (AI & Predictive Systems)**
*   **Cognitive Search:** Deploying AI Vision (photo) and Voice search for seamless part identification in noisy workshops.
*   **Dynamic Pricing:** ML-driven pricing engine that adjusts based on demand, garage tier, and city-level margins.
*   **Autonomous Support:** Launching AI Voice Bots for automated order tracking and status queries.

## 🤖 How We Use AI

We leverage Artificial Intelligence to eliminate friction and reduce manual overhead by **60-80%**.

*   **Computer Vision:** Garage mechanics can identify complex parts instantly by simply taking a photo.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Voice-to-Part search tailored for the specific vocabulary of auto-parts in multi-lingual environments.
*   **Autonomous Communication:** AI Voice Management systems handle inbound/outbound calls for status updates, ETAs, and follow-ups without human intervention.
*   **Intelligent Cataloguing:** AI-driven attribute extraction and categorization of thousands of supplier SKUs into our master database.

## 📊 How We Use Data Science

Data is our most valuable asset. We transform raw transactions into predictive power to protect margins and ensure reliability.

*   **Predictive Demand Forecasting:** SKU-level forecasting to predict what parts will be needed at which dark store, preventing stockouts.
*   **Dynamic Pricing Engine:** ML models analyze market trends, competitor pricing, and garage behavior to optimize gross margins in real-time.
*   **Algorithmic Routing:** Data-driven route optimization and batching to minimize last-mile costs and meet strict delivery SLAs (<60 mins).
*   **Behavioral Analytics:** Cohort analysis and churn prediction to identify high-value garages and trigger proactive retention workflows.
*   **Fraud Detection:** Real-time monitoring of orders and returns to identify and prevent leakage in the fulfillment chain.
